## What's New: v2.0.0

- Organized Tracker+ [[Dashboard|Examples & Documentation]]
  - Separated and renamed files to be more descriptive
  - Added tags to allow for easier discovery while using the example vault in Obsidian
  - Updates links to be relative
- Moved documentation to `/examples/Ξdocumentation` so it is available while using the example vault in Obsidian

## Usage

1. Have some data you want to track in daily notes
2. Add a new note for displaying the tracker
3. Add tracker code blocks manually ([examples](https://github.com/greater-than/Obsidian-Tracker-Plus/blob/main/examples)) or using [commands](./sample-vault/Ξdocumentation/Commands.md)
4. Switch the document view mode to 'Preview', then the code block will get rendered

## Examples & Documentation

Tracker+ examples and documentation have been authored using Obsidian. Open the `/sample-vault` directory in Obsidian, and make sure the plugins are installed and enabled.
