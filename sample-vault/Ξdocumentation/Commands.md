# Commands

To smooth the process of adding tracker code blocks, Tracker+ provides three commands (There will be more in the future release):

- "Add Line Chart Tracker"
- "Add Bar Chart Tracker"
- "Add Summary Tracker"

Type Ctrl/Cmd+P to activate the command palette, then type "Tracker+" to search these commands.

These commands will add a code block to the next line below your cursor position. The code block will contain the most frequently used keys. To see the complete list of input parameters and description, see [Input Parameters](Input%20Parameters.md).
