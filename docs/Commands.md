# Commands

To smooth the process of making trackers, obsidian-tracker provides three commands (There will be more in the future release), "Add Line Chart Tracker", "Add Bar Chart Tracker", and "Add Summary Tracker". Just type Ctrl/Cmd+P to activate the command palette, then type "Tracker" to search these commands.

After a command is executed, a code block will be added to the next line below your cursor position for you. The added code block will contain the most frequently used keys. To see the complete list of input parameters and description, please check [this document](https://github.com/greater-than/Obsidian-TrackerGT/blob/main/docs/InputParameters.md).
