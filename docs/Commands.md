# Commands

To smooth the process of making trackers, obsidian-tracker provides three commands (There will be more in the future release), "Add Line Chart Tracker", "Add Bar Chart Tracker", and "Add Summary Tracker". Just type Ctrl/Cmd+P to activate the command palette, then type "Tracker" to search these commands.

These commands will add a code block to the next line below your cursor position. The code block will contain the most frequently used keys. To see the complete list of input parameters and description, please check [this document](https://github.com/greater-than/Obsidian-Tracker-Plus/blob/main/docs/InputParameters.md).
